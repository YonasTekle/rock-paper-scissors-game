Rock paper scissors are played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V.

In this game, the userâ€™s opponent is the computer and the computer chose randomly rock paper and scissors. Users of the game will learn the rules of the game.
